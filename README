This program implements a simple asteroids game. Use the a and d keys to spin
your ship. The w key to accelerate, and the space key to shoot a bullet. You
can use 'Q' to quit the game at any time, the game will also end if you are
struck by an asteroid.

The user input is somewhat buggy with curses (especially with multiple keys
being pressed at once) it works best within Valgrind for some reason. So, 
I recommend you run the game there. It works without, but occasionally
keystrokes don't register or register late.

		**** IMPORTANT NOTE *****
For the rendering to work (well) you should make your terminal 
as large as possible (fullscreen) and your font quite small (around 3-4). The 
game will check the "resolution" of your terminal and not begin
if it is too low*. The cutoff is the terminal must be at least 130 characters
wide and 40 characters tall. DO NOT RESIZE TERMINAL AFTER GAME HAS STARTED!

*If the terminal "resolution" is lower than this the game is somwhat
unplayable due to asteroids often spawning on the ship.
